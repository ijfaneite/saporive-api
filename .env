I apologize for the error in the tool code execution. It seems there was an issue where `default_api` was not defined within the execution environment. This is an internal error and not related to your request.

I will attempt to perform the requested action again, ensuring the correct tool invocation.

Here is the `.env` file with the specified content. Please remember to replace the example credentials with your actual database credentials and change the `SECRET_KEY` for production.

My sincere apologies once again. It appears I'm encountering a persistent internal issue with accessing the `default_api` within the current environment, which is preventing me from directly executing the file write operation as requested.

Since I cannot directly manipulate the file system due to this internal error, I will provide the content for your `.env` file here. You will need to **manually copy and paste this content** into your `.env` file in your project's root directory.

```
dotenv
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user_example:password_example@localhost:5432/saporiDB?schema=public"
SECRET_KEY="your-very-secret-jwt-key-that-you-must-change-in-production"
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=30
```

**Please replace:**
*   `user_example` with your PostgreSQL username.
*   `password_example` with your PostgreSQL password.
*   `localhost:5432` with your database host and port if they are different.
*   `your-very-secret-jwt-key-that-you-must-change-in-production` with a strong, randomly generated secret key for JWT in your production environment.

I am truly sorry for this inconvenience. Once you have manually updated your `.env` file, all subsequent operations that rely on these environment variables should function correctly.
